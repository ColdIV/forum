# How to contribute to the forum
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple way of setting up and maintaining a web forum. 
We welcome contributions from everyone!

### Find an issue to work on
You can take a look at the existing issues [here](https://github.com/coldiv/forum/issues). If you like to get started on an issue, please drop us a comment in the issue or assign yourself to it. If you have any questions, we are happy to help. 

You are also welcome to open your own issue if you:
- found a bug. In this case, please explain how to reproduce the bug.
- found something to improve. In this case, please explain your idea in detail.

### Create a pull request
If you found an issue to work on, you can create a pull request to resolve an issue. In your PR description, specify which issue will be resolved by your changes. 
One of the core contributors will then review your PR as soon as possible.

Please follow these guidelines:

- Always create a branch from `master` and check if it will merge cleanly before submitting your PR.
- Make sure to test your changes thoroughly before sumbitting your PR.
- Small commits are preferred but should be reasonable. (Don't put every text-change in an extra commit)
